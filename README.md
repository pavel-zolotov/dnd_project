# D&D project
 
### NOTE! 
App won't compile because of the lack of google-services.json file. This file required by Firebase backend used to sync characters across user's devices. Unfortunately, this file is not public available on the security purpose.

### How to solve it?
If you want to try out our application, just install .apk file from this repo. In case you want to build app from source code, create your own Firebase project and download google-services.json from Firebase console.
